    article: '''The Cleveland Cavaliers fired head coach J.B. Bickerstaff on Thursday, the team announced. Bickerstaff had a 170-159 regular-season record as Cleveland's head coach across parts of five seasons. The Cavaliers reached the playoffs in the last two of those seasons, but even as they competed for a top seed in the Eastern Conference this season, there was reportedly tension underneath the surface.

"J.B. is a well-respected NBA coach and an incredible human being," Cavaliers President of Basketball Operations Koby Altman said in a statement. "Over the past four years, he helped establish a culture that progressively drove players to become the best versions of themselves. Decisions like these are never easy, particularly when you look back at where this franchise rebuild started under his leadership."

Warriors assistant Kenny Atkinson and Pelicans associate James Borrego are expected to be among the candidates for the job, according to Shams Charania of the Athletic.

In a report released after Cleveland's season-ending loss to the Boston Celtics, The Athletic's Charania, Joe Vardon and Jason Lloyd detailed several incidents that hinted at Bickerstaff's hot seat. After a December game against the Houston Rockets, Altman reportedly criticized Bickerstaff in front of his entire staff for playing star guard Donovan Mitchell too many minutes. Players were also reportedly frustrated with the offense and the lack of structure in practices and shootarounds.

Bickerstaff's teams had also developed a habit of underwhelming late in seasons. Over the past three seasons, the Cavaliers have gone 30-33 in games played after March 1 of that year. Those declines tended to follow Cleveland into the postseason. The 2022 team failed to reach the playoffs despite having two chances to get in through the Play-In Tournament. In 2023, they lost to the New York Knicks in the first round despite having a home-court advantage and playing against an injured Julius Randle. 

This postseason, they very nearly lost in the first round again with home-court advantage, this time to the Orlando Magic. They ultimately won that series in seven games thanks to Mitchell's heroics before bowing out in the second round against the Boston Celtics. Mitchell, according to The Athletic, "did not have great confidence in Bickerstaff."

Mitchell's future is likely informing every decision Cleveland makes this offseason. He is eligible for a contract extension this offseason, and if he does not sign it, he will become a free agent next summer. Should he inform the Cavaliers that he does not plan to extend, Cleveland would have to explore trade scenarios for fear of risking losing him for nothing. Even if Mitchell stays, Cleveland would still need to explore possible moves involving Darius Garland, its other small, offensively-oriented guard, and Jarrett Allen and Evan Mobley, as Cleveland's offense only really worked this season with one big man on the floor.

It is going to be an offseason of change for the Cavaliers. This is just the first of what will surely be several moves Cleveland makes as it attempts to recover from yet another playoff disappointment.

    title: 'The rise of Dereck Lively II: From late-blooming high school star to Mavericks rookie revelation ',
    image: 'assets/images/news/2.png',
    date: 'May 22',
    author: 'Sam Quinn',
    readTime: 5,
    article: '''When the buzzer sounded at the end of Game 6 of the Western Conference second round, Dereck Lively II was hailed a hero. The 7-foot rookie was thick in Dallas' celebration of advancing to the Western Conference finals, largely due to his efforts. He posted a game-high plus-minus with the Mavericks outscoring the Thunder by 26 points when Lively was on the floor. His dunks, rebounds, and rim protection were vital in securing a one-point victory over the No. 1 seed. 

It was the culmination of everything Lively had experienced in his life playing out on the biggest stage.

"If you want to play with anybody, you want to play with Dereck," Duke coach Jon Scheyer told CBS Sports this week. "He's carved out his own path to how he was going to do it. That's what I'm most proud of." 

Nearly three years ago, Lively had climbed his way to becoming a top recruit in the 2022 class, at times holding the No. 1 spot. While being the top player in a class is an honor, it also comes with scrutiny and an intense microscope. In Lively's case, his journey to becoming the top-ranked recruit was a blend of circumstance and development.

Following his seventh-grade season, Lively joined the Team Final AAU program as a talented, albeit green, prospect. At the time, Team Final boasted three talented and proven players: future lottery pick Jalen Duren, Jameel Brown, and Justice Williams.

"He came to tryouts with his mom, and it was an eye-opening experience for him," said Team Final director Rob Brown. "He was from just outside of State College [Pennsylvania], his mom obviously worked at Penn State, and he had never seen players like Jalen Duren or even Jameel Brown, who was a USA kid at the time, or Justice Williams in the gym. It was eye-opening for him but it was something that he needed."

Lively was talented, just like Duren. But unlike the chiseled-for-his-age Duren, Lively needed time to grow into his own. The gangly Lively was on the path to bloom late.

"When Duren came to us in seventh grade, he was already physically gifted like somebody four or five years older than him," Brown said. "For him, it was easy physically and athletically to impose his size on people. With Dereck, he was not as developed, but you could still see, 'Wow, this kid is going to be really, really good.' He is going to be different than Jalen, but he is going to be good in his own way."

When Lively entered high school at Westtown School in Chester, PA, he was under the radar due to both injuries and then the COVID-19 pandemic. This gave him the opportunity to expand his game and burst onto the national scene during his junior season.

Dereck's mother, Katherine Drysdale, was a Penn State basketball standout who scored over 1,200 points and stood 6-foot-4. His father, Derek Sr., was tall, too. 

"You knew he was going to continue to grow, but you didn't know he was going to be 7-foot-1," Brown said. "His game developed at his pace."

Towards the end of his junior season, Lively began to turn heads and made a large leap up the 247Sports rankings from the top 50 up into the top 25. The conversations began that he might climb into the top 5 of the recruiting rankings -- he just needed time to prove it. Playing with Duren and heralded recruit Emoni Bates, his Team Final tore through the Nike EYBL on their way to winning a Peach Jam title, the most prestigious championship on the shoe circuit series. During that run, Lively proved to be an elite defender, a high-level rim protector, a lob catcher, and someone with the potential to stretch the floor (an element we have not seen yet at the higher levels). 

Everything he brought to the floor impacted winning, and it was a big reason why Duke head coach Jon Scheyer put all his efforts into landing the big man as the jewel of what would be his first signing class. Lively continued his rise up to the top of the class despite not being your prototypical star recruit who could go out and get 30 on any given night. However, due to reclassifications between Duren, Bates, and Shaedon Sharpe, Lively rose near the top of the rankings and finished No. 2 in 247Sports' rankings for the 2022 class. Lively was the headliner of a 2022 signing class that included five five-star prospects. 

Along with the lofty expectations came another setback when Lively injured his foot at the start of Duke's 2022-23 season. The injury lingered and affected Lively's play (from Nov. 30 to Jan. 28, only once did Lively crack over 20 minutes per game). 

"When you get injured to start the year as a freshman, you're going through growing pains in real time during the season," Scheyer said. "Usually, you go through them during the preseason, and so I thought he showed incredible mental toughness by just sticking with it, learning what it takes at that level, and obviously preparing him for the following year."

Lively buckled down with then-assistant Amile Jefferson, a former Duke big man himself, to create daily habits in getting back to form. Jefferson is now an assistant coach for the Boston Celtics. 

"He had an amazing workout routine that he developed with Amile," Scheyer said. "He had an offensive routine and a defensive routine that he would do. He was consistent. We had multiple meetings where he just doubled down on what he needed to do, and he didn't make any excuses. That's what you love about him, and that's why he got better."

Most of Lively's numbers during one year in Durham were a mixed bag. He averaged just 5.2 points and 5.4 rebounds a game, but he also blocked 82 shots, fifth most nationally and 10th-most in a Duke single season. Lively was named to the 2023 All-ACC Tournament Team, ACC All-Defensive Team, and ACC All-Freshman Team.

"What Dereck brings to the table is different than anybody else," Scheyer said. "He's not a guy you throw the ball to to go create shots, but he was the most impactful defensive player in the country by the end of the season."

The Mavs selected Lively No. 12 in the 2023 NBA Draft (he'd go much higher in a redraft). He's one of five former five-star recruits on Dallas' roster, which includes former Duke point guard Kyrie Irving, too. The Mavericks are benefiting from Lively's intangibles. 

Lively struggled in both Game 1 and Game 2 against Oklahoma City, but he doubled down and found a way to change the course of the series and head to the Western Conference finals.

"We wouldn't win this series without (Lively)," Mavs star Luka Doncic said. "For a rookie not being scared, it's insane how he plays ... The way he impacts the game is just amazing." 

Lively's father died at a young age. His mother, Kathy Drysdale, died of cancer just over a month ago on April 12 after a decades-long battle. The tests Lively faces on the court -- and Karl-Anthony Towns and Rudy Gobert will be quite the test Wednesday night in Minneapolis -- is nothing compared to what he's gone threw off it. 

"He has a big personality, and you're seeing parts of his dad come out where he is loud, in a very positive way," Brown said. "When he catches a lob, he is screaming at the crowd. It's infectious. It's almost momentum-changing plays that he makes. 

"When his mom got cancer, it threw it into a different place. Where he used to play for inspiration -- his mom was his inspiration because she fought so hard to get past cancer -- now he is playing with a purpose."''',

    title: 'Celtics vs. Pacers: Jrue Holiday\'s bully-ball offense poses an unsolvable problem for Indiana defenders ',
    image: 'assets/images/news/3.png',
    date: 'May 22',
    author: 'Sam Quinn',
    readTime: 3,
    article: '''Tyrese Haliburton pointed to the obvious when asked about Jrue Holiday after Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals. "He's the best defender in the NBA," the All-Star guard declared. "He has been for a long time." Haliburton wasn't far off.

Holiday was named to his sixth All-Defensive team on Tuesday. Among active guards, only Chris Paul has been chosen to more. Holiday was the primary matchup on Haliburton in Game 1, and while Indiana's floor general largely played well, Holiday came away with three huge steals. With the Pacers trailing by one with just over one minute remaining in overtime, Holiday's forced turnover allowed Jayson Tatum to push the lead to four on a 3-pointer and effectively seal the win. Even now, with his 34th birthday mere weeks away, Holiday remains one of the NBA's very best defenders.

But the Celtics have plenty of great defenders, and others like Marcus Smart and Robert Williams III are no longer part of this team because defense has never really been the issue in the postseason. Where things tend to go haywire is on the offensive end. At their worst, the Celtics devolve into an offense that mindlessly jacks up 3-pointers and turns the ball over because they cannot generate easier shots. This is where Holiday came in so handy against the Pacers in Game 1. While his 4-of-8 3-point shooting was obviously critical, it was his ability to create points near the rim against weaker defenders that saved the Celtics on Tuesday.

The word "weaker" is literal here. Holiday was just too big and too strong for most of Indiana's perimeter players. Just look at how easily he seals for position against Haliburton before the ball even arrives.''',

    article: '''The 2024 Western Conference Finals begin on Wednesday, and neither of the top two seeds in the West will be taking the court. The No. 5 seeded Dallas Mavericks look to knock off their third straight higher seed when going against the No. 3 Minnesota Timberwolves with Game 1 at 8:30 p.m. ET in Minnesota. Will the Dallas backcourt tandem of Luka Doncic and Kyrie Irving outshine the Minnesota options in the NBA DFS player pool, resulting in another upset? Dallas lost each of its previous Game 1 matchups before coming back to win the series, so how should that affect your NBA DFS strategy?

Minnesota has the size advantage with Karl-Anthony Towns and Rudy Gobert, so should daily Fantasy basketball players include either of them in NBA DFS picks? Anthony Edwards is averaging 28.9 points in the postseason, but to include some of these stars in NBA DFS lineups, who are some values in the NBA DFS player pool to consider on sites like FanDuel and DraftKings? Derrick Jones Jr. had 22 points in Game 6 for Dallas, so could he be a value piece for NBA DFS lineups? Before making your NBA DFS picks for Mavericks vs. Timberwolves, be sure to check out the NBA DFS advice, player rankings, stacks, and top daily Fantasy basketball picks from SportsLine's Jimmie Kaylor.

Kaylor is a DFS and betting expert for SportsLine, who won a DraftKings Millionaire Maker contest in 2022. He uses a combination of his background as a former college and professional athlete and his keen eye for statistical trends when making his picks and locking in his DFS lineups. Kaylor enters the 2024 calendar year with multiple five-figure tournament cashes on his DFS resume.

Kaylor's approach allows him to find the best NBA DFS values and create optimal lineups that he only shares on SportsLine. They're a must-see for any NBA DFS player.

On Tuesday, Kaylor highlighted Celtics forward Jayson Tatum as one of his top picks in his NBA DFS player pool on both sites. The result: Tatum had 36 points, 12 rebounds, four assists and three steals, returning 63.5 points on DraftKings and 61.4 points on FanDuel as the top scorer from the NBA DFS player pool. Anybody who included him in their lineups was well on the way to a profitable day.

Kaylor has turned his attention to NBA action on Wednesday and locked in his top daily Fantasy basketball picks. You can only see them by heading to SportsLine.
Top NBA DFS picks for Wednesday, May 22

For Wednesday, one of Kaylor's top NBA DFS picks is Mavericks point guard Doncic. The five-time All-Star is averaging 27.3 points, 9.7 rebounds and 9.1 assists this postseason. He's had a triple-double in three straight games, averaging 26 points, 10.7 rebounds and 10.3 assists over those contests. Doncic led the NBA in scoring at 33.9 ppg during the regular season for his second straight season averaging more than 30 ppg.

Doncic is integral to everything Dallas does offensively, and the Mavericks will need another huge series from him to pull off a third straight upset. With three full days of rest, Doncic should be ready to take on another huge minutes total after playing 45 minutes in Game 6 versus Oklahoma City. Doncic averaged 36.5 points, six rebounds and 10.5 assists in two meetings against Minnesota this season, and although he comes with a hefty price tag, his floor and ceiling leave him as a player you don't want to be without in NBA DFS lineups. 

Another part of Kaylor's optimal NBA DFS strategy includes rostering Timberwolves power forward/center Naz Reid. The 25-year-old has scored double-digit points in back-to-back games while averaging 7.5 rebounds during those contests. Reid is the team's leading scorer off the bench this postseason, averaging 10.4 ppg, so he can provide value at a cheaper price to fill NBA DFS lineups. 

The Timberwolves may want to take advantage of their size advantage against a guard-heavy Mavericks offense, and Reid provides size as a 6-foot-9 paint presence. Reid averaged 15.8 points and 6.8 rebounds over four games against Dallas this season as his size and athleticism have given Dallas' big men problems. Kaylor sees Reid as a piece with the potential to outperform his price while allowing money to spend on higher-priced players to fill out NBA DFS picks on Wednesday.

    title: 'JJ Redick jokes about Lakers coaching rumors with LeBron James: \'There\'s other things happening in NBA world\'',
    image: 'assets/images/news/6.png',
    date: 'May 23',

    article: '''LeBron James has reportedly stayed out of the Los Angeles Lakers coaching search, but his Mind the Game podcast cohost JJ Redick is one of the names floating around as a potential candidate. During a recent episode, they joked about all the buzz surrounding the situation.

"There's other things happening in the NBA world, non-playoff related, that I feel like the NBA media is using as well," Redick said.

James understood what he meant, laughed, and replied, "Absolutely," without going into any more details on the not-so-subtle inside joke.

    🤔 “There’s other things happening in the NBA World, non-playoff related, that I feel like the NBA Media is using as well [for content]” - JJ Redick 😂

    Mind the Game Podcast with Lebron James 👀 pic.twitter.com/cGR3zwgdEv
    — The Laker Files (@LakerFiles) May 22, 2024

Redick played 15 seasons in the NBA, but he does not have previous coaching experience. Despite that weakness on his resume, Shams Charania reported that Redick has already had a formal meeting with the Lakers. The same goes for New Orleans Pelicans associate head coach James Borrego and Boston Celtics assistant coach Sam Cassell.

James and Redick seem to have good chemistry while discussing various basketball topics in their podcast, which has only been around since March. However, this does not mean they will definitely end up together in Los Angeles. Charania reported that James intends to leave the hiring decision to the Lakers' front office, and he also has not discussed the position with Redick.

"LeBron James and JJ Redick, they do a podcast together," James' agent, Rich Paul, told Charania. "That does not mean that [James] wants Redick as his head coach."

The 39-year-old Lakers star could become a free agent this summer. Although he is currently the face of the franchise, Los Angeles is not necessarily trying to hire a coach to keep him happy. Instead, the focus might be more on who would work best for Anthony Davis, who is only 31 years old. 

"We'll see what LeBron James decides for his future," Charania said in the Run it Back show. "Obviously I'm told he's expected to play up to two more seasons. The bottom line with LeBron James is this -- if he were making the decisions for the Lakers, Ty Lue would've been the head coach in 2019. Kyrie Irving would be his point guard if he were running the team and if he was making the decisions."
